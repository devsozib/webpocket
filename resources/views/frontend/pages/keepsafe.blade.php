                        <strong>TYPES OF FRAUD.</strong><br>
                          <strong>FAKE CALL SAYING POCKET ACCOUNT IS CLOSED</strong><br>
                          <p class="step">have mistakenly blocked your account instead of another POCKET account. The fraudster may also say that he has already informed the POCKET authorities about the matter and may say that an officer of POCKET will contact you to unblock the account. Then someone posing as a fake POCKET representative can call you on the pretext of unblocking the account and grab the verification code (OTP) and PIN (PIN) received in your message which can cause harm financially.</p>
                          <strong>FAKE CALLS OR MESSAGES ABOUT GRANTS/ALLOWANCES/STIPENDS</strong><br>
                          <p class="step">Fraudsters ask you to call certain numbers or may directly call you presenting some fake information such as stipend, old age allowance, government grant, rural electricity facility, etc. Next, you will be asked to provide the Verification Code (OTP) and your POCKET PIN (PIN) received in the message to verify your account. Also asks you to add some money to your number. If you are persuaded and do as they say, you can become a victim of fraud.</p>
                          <strong>ACCOUNT UPDATE/INFORMATION UPDATE</strong><br>
                        
                          <p>Fraud acting as a POCKET representative may call/message you and collect required confidential information from you by persuading you with various information (e.g.: launching new services, updating information) or by threatening (e.g.: account will be closed if no information will be updated). If you share the OTP and PIN after being prompted, your account is under the control of fraudsters.</p>

                          <strong>IMO/MESSENGER/WHATSAPP</strong><br>
                          <p>Fraudster lures you with fake information by messaging you acting as someone you know on IMO/Messenger/WhatsApp or by hacking someone's IMO/Messenger account and sending messages from that account. Then asks you to send money/add money to a given POCKET number. If you add money or send money without verifying the fact of the request, you will be a victim of fraud.</p>
                          <strong>ACCIDENT FAKE NEWS</strong><br>
                          <p>Scammers may call you by pretending to be a member of law enforcement or impersonating the voice of a relative or acquaintance. Then they mentally blackmail you with any sudden news of accident/death of someone you know or by any fake information and will ask you to send money/add money for immediate help or assistance. If you send money without verifying the facts, you will be a victim of fraud.</p>
                          <strong>FALSE OFFERS/ADVERTISEMENTS</strong><br>
                          <p>Fraudsters may induce you through SMS/call/Facebook posts/websites with fake jobs, offers of services or products of POCKET or other companies, fake advertisement, etc. and for that form fill up, they may direct you to send/pay the registration fee or tax/VAT fee as advance money in specific POCKET accounts of customers. If you fall into their trap by being tempted, you will be deceived.</p>
                          <strong>MERCHANT MASKING OR HEAD OFFICE OFFICER</strong><br>
                          <p>Fraudsters mask POCKET merchant numbers or call POCKET merchants posing as POCKET head office officials and lure them with various offers. For example, Activating Merchant Apps/Opening Savings Accounts/Increasing Commission/Linking Personal Accounts/Reducing Bank Transfer Charges of Personal Accounts/Distributing Merchant Banner/Poster, etc. To gain those offers they may ask the merchant or personal number to add money to activate offers. As a result, they are victims of fraud.</p>
                          <strong>WHAT TO DO TO AVOID FRAUD</strong><br>
                          <p>POCKET Account PIN (PIN) and 4-digit verification code (OTP) received in SMS are your confidential information. POCKET never asks for your PIN and 4-digit verification code (OTP) sent in SMS by calling 16800 or any other number. So, anyone who wants this information will understand that he is a fraud. If someone calls you asking for confidential information, hang up.
                            Also, the scammer may call and ask to check the POCKET account balance or ask to dial your PIN, SMS verification code (OTP) while on the call. Never dial your PIN number or verification code sent to your phone while on the phone. Again, instead of asking for your PIN directly, it may add/subtract, multiply/divide by a number and ask for that number. In case of such an incident, hang up the phone without talking and immediately call 16800 and inform the POCKET authority. Also, if you are careful about the following things, you will never be a victim of fraud.
                            Under no circumstances share the POCKET PIN or Verification Code (OTP) received in the message while on the call.
                            If someone asks you to multiply/divide, add/subtract a number without knowing the PIN directly, avoid it.
                            If someone asks you to check your POCKET account balance while on a call, avoid doing so.
                            If the new POCKET merchant gets a call from the head office officer and asks the merchant to share something or make a money transaction on the phone, immediately hang up the phone. And inform him by calling SR's number saved in your mobile.
                            If someone asks you to send money by making a call or messaging from emo/ whatâ€™s app/messenger; please make sure that you know them before making the transaction.
                            If you see any promotional offer or post of POCKET other than the verified online page or website of POCKET, first verify the authenticity of the information by calling the helpline 16800.
                            What to do if you already cheated
                            If you think you've been scammed, follow these steps:
                            In the first instance, report the matter to POCKET authorities immediately by calling POCKET Helpline 16800 or through other customer services. Try to explain the timing of the cheating and how you were cheated.
                            Change your POCKET Account PIN quickly. Do not share the new PIN with anyone while changing the PIN. In this case, you can get help by calling the POCKET Helpline at 16800 or through other customer services.
